## 1. Dynamic Menu (Navbar)

The dynamic menu prominently displays a predetermined list of menu items and transfers remaining items to a designated "More" section when they cannot fit within the main menu. The responsive design allows for reorganization and migration of menu items as the screen size changes.

Key features of the dynamic menu implementation:

- **Screen Responsiveness:** The menu adapts to screen size changes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Auto-Reorganization:** As the screen size decreases, items migrate to the "More" section. Conversely, with an increase in screen size, items reintegrate into the main menu.

- **User Interaction:** Clicking or selecting menu items activates them, providing a user-friendly experience.

- **Show/Hide "More" Section:** The "More" section can be shown or hidden to manage space effectively.

## 2. Carousel

The circular carousel showcases featured items, enabling users to navigate through the carousel using arrow controls and user interactions with the displayed cards. The carousel offers a smooth transition to the main card upon user interaction and creates an infinite loop of content on navigation.

Key features of the carousel implementation:

- **Circular Rotation:** The items in the carousel rotate continuously in a circular manner, ensuring an infinite loop of content.

- **Arrow Controls:** Users can navigate through the carousel using arrow controls.

- **User Interaction:** Clicking or selecting a card highlights the selected item and smoothly transitions to the main card.
